# alekny-mastercomfig-preset
A custom preset for [mastercomfig](https://www.mastercomfig.com/)

#### What is this?
This custom preset is based on the mastercomfig "medium low"-preset, changes include:
* Enabling shadows=medium (because they are still visible through walls in a lot if situations)
* Setting textures and lod to high (just looks a lot better)
* Enabling phong shading (make australiums look gold and shiny)
* Enabling sprays
* Setting Bandwidth to 8Mbps (make the most out of good connections)
* Enabling Killstreak-Sheens
* Enabling outlines on objectives like the cart in pl
* Enabling HUD-Playermodel
* Adding some cool net_graph settings when pressing and holding "tab"
* Force mat_queue_mode 2

#### Install Instructions
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/alekny/alekny-mastercomfig-preset/releases) and place "alekny-mastercomfig-preset.vpk" into your "tf/custom" folder together with any mastercomfig preset vpk.  
NOTICE: This will override any existing preset!

#### Preset Update Instructions
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/alekny/alekny-mastercomfig-preset/releases) and replace it with your existing "alekny-mastercomfig-preset.vpk".
I will design it to work with the latest stable version of mastercomfig. However it will very likely work with older versions as well.

#### Mastercomfig Update Instructions
Just update your mastercomfig vpk and leave "alekny-mastercomfig-preset.vpk" where it is.

Enjoy :>
