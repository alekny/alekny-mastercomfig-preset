# alekny-mastercomfig-preset
A custom preset for [mastercomfig](https://www.mastercomfig.com/)

#### Install Instructions
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/alekny/alekny-mastercomfig-preset/releases) and place "alekny-preset.vpk" into your "tf/custom" folder together with any mastercomfig preset vpk.
It will then override the built-in preset.

#### Mastercomfig Update Instructions
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/alekny/alekny-mastercomfig-preset/releases) and replace it with your existing "alekny-preset.vpk".
I will design it to work with the latest stable version of mastercomfig. However it will very likely work with older versions as well.

#### Mastercomfig Update Instructions
Just update your mastercomfig vpk and leave "alekny-preset.vpk" where it is.

Enjoy :>
